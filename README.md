### Range of randomModifier in the damage formula

An integer in the range [900, 1100):

- 900: inclusive lower bound (0.9 `randomModifier` is possible)
- 1100: exclusive upper bound (1.1 `randomModifier` is **not** possible)

[C# method reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.random.next?view=netframework-4.8#System_Random_Next_System_Int32_System_Int32_).

### Maximum value of total powerMod

1000%.

### Lower and upper bounds of buffs

- Some common factors in the damage formula

| Damage formula term | Buff Action | Default Value | Lower Bound | Upper Bound |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| atkMod | atk | 100% | 0 | 500% |
| defMod | defence | 100% | 0 | N/A |
| cardMod | commandAtk | 100% | 0 | 500% |
| cardMod | commandDef | 100% | N/A | 500% |
| powerMod | damage | 0% | N/A | 1000% |
| critDamageMod | criticalDamage | 0% | N/A | 500% |
| npDamageMod | npdamage | 0% | N/A | 500% |
| specialDefMod | specialdefence | 0% | -100% | 400% |

- NP gain

| NP gain formula term | Buff Action | Default Value | Lower Bound | Upper Bound |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cardMod | commandNpAtk | 100% | 0 | 500% |
| cardMod | commandNpDef | 100% | N/A | 500% |
| npChargeRateMod | dropNp | 100% | 0 | 500% |

- Crit stars

| Crit stars formula term | Buff Action | Default Value | Lower Bound | Upper Bound |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| cardMod | commandStarAtk | 100% | 0 | 500% |
| cardMod | commandStarDef | 100% | N/A | 500% |
| starDropMod | criticalPoint | 100% | 0 | 500% |
| enemyStarDropMod | criticalPoint | 100% | 0 | 500% |

Here's how the buff values are collected and summed up in the game code:
- Each term in the damage formula corresponds to one or many buff actions. Buff actions are like buff categories containing positive and negative buff types.
  - The mapping of damage formula terms to buff actions can be found [here](https://github.com/atlasacademy/fgo-game-data-docs/blob/master/battle/damage.md).
  - The mapping of buff actions to positive and negative buff types can be found [here](https://api.atlasacademy.io/export/JP/NiceBuffList.ActionList.json).
  - For example: `atkMod` refers to the `atk` buff action which contains `upAtk` plusTypes and `downAtk` minusTypes. [Charisma buff](https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/#/NA/buff/126) has buff type `upAtk`.

- Buff actions values are calculated using the following formula:
```python
num = buffAction.baseParam + (total plusTypes buffs values) - (total minusTypes buff values)

if buffAction.limit in (normal, lower):
    if num < 0:
        num = 0

num = num - buffAction.baseValue;

if buffAction.limit in (normal, upper):
    if maxRate < num:
        num = maxRate

return num
```
- Explanation of the variables:
  - Buff action variables can be found [here](https://api.atlasacademy.io/export/JP/NiceBuffList.ActionList.json):
    - `baseParam`
    - `baseValue`
    - `limit`
  - `maxRate` is a property of the buff item. This value can be found in the [DB](https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/#/) or [API](https://api.atlasacademy.io/docs). If there are multiple buffs, the max `maxRate` is used. Different buffs of the same buff action usually have the same `maxRate` value.
  - For example: we are trying to calculate `cardMod` with 10 level 10 Merlin's [Hero Creation](https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/#/NA/skill/323650) applied and no buster damage down:
    - `cardMod` -> buff action `commandAtk` -> `plusTypes` [buff type](https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/#/NA/buff/102) `upCommandall`
      - `baseParam`: 1000
      - `baseValue`: 0
      - `limit`: normal
      - `maxRate`: 5000
    - `num` = 1000 + 500 * 10 = 6000 (`baseParam` = 1000 and there are 10 Hero Creation, each has `Value` of 500)
    - `limit` is normal but `num` > 0 so lower bound is not applied
    - `num` = `num` - `baseValue` = 6000 - 0 = 6000
    - `limit` is normal and `num` > `maxRate` so upper bound is applied -> `num` = 5000
    - The final `cardMod` value is 5000 or 500%.

Notes:
- It's not quite correct to say the max value of `powerMod` is 1000%. As seen in [the formula mapping](https://github.com/atlasacademy/fgo-game-data-docs/blob/master/battle/damage.md), `powerMod` consists of 4 buff actions and each of them has their own limits. However, most of the common `powerMod` buffs fall into buff action `damage` which has an upper limit of 1000%.
- The interaction can get pretty messy so when in doubt, follow the formula step by step. I purposefully used "Default Value" in the table above instead of "baseParam" or "baseValue".
- There are also some floors in the [damage formula](https://github.com/atlasacademy/fgo-game-data-docs/blob/master/battle/damage.md) that might affect the effective buff value.

### Unstackable buffs

Buffs which have the __same non-zero buff group__ are unstackable. For example:
- Both [Petrify](https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/#/NA/buff/176) from Gorgon's [Mystic Eyes A++](https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/#/NA/skill/93552) and [Stun](https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/#/NA/buff/178) from Plugsuit's [Gandr](https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/#/NA/skill/980005) have buff group 500 so they don't stack.
- [Guts](https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/#/JP/buff/180) from [Herc's bond CE](https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/#/JP/craft-essence/197) is of buff group 600 and [Guts](https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/#/JP/buff/2932) from [Herc's 3<sup>rd</sup> skill post strengthening](https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/#/JP/buff/2932) has buff group 601 so they can stack.
- Both [Cu's 2nd skill](https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/#/NA/servant/17/skill-2) and the CE [Under the Sun](https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/#/NA/craft-essence/773) use the same [buff 151](https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/#/NA/buff/151) for the Evade effect. This buff has buff group 200 so Cu's skill and the CE's effects can't stack.
- A lot of skills use the same [buff 102](https://apps.atlasacademy.io/db/#/NA/buff/102) for the Buster Up effect. This buff has buff group 0 so a servant can carry multiple Buster Up buffs.

### enemyServerMod in the NP gain formula

[The NP gain formula](https://blogs.nrvnqsr.com/entry.php/3306-How-much-NP-do-I-get-in-combat).

The `enemyServerMod`s in the attacking and defending formulas refer to two different variables in the enemy data: `tdRate` for attacking NP gain and `tdAttackRate` for defending NP gain. They are usually the same but there's no code requirement for them to be identical.

### How MISS and GUARD are determined

The status effect proc check is still as described in [Kyte's post](https://blogs.nrvnqsr.com/entry.php/3311-How-is-effect-success-rate-calculated). MISS and GUARD are only for display. Here's how they are determined:

* num3 = status effect chance
* random roll = random integer in range [0, 1000)
* num2 = target's resistance + random roll
* if num2 > num3: buff fails
  * if num2 > 1000 (100%): it displays GUARD, otherwise MISS

As a result of this, a failed 100% chance status effect can only display GUARD.

For example, with Shuten's first skill (60% chance Charm, 100% chance DEF down) against shadow Medusa in the X-E FQ with 17.5% resistance:

* Charm effect:
  * Example 1:
    * num3 = 600
    * random roll = 876
    * num2 = 876 + 175 = 1051
    * 1051 > 600 -> buff fails
      * 1051 > 1000 -> displays GUARD
  * Example 2:
    * num3 = 600
    * random roll = 598
    * num2 = 598 + 175 = 773
    * 773 > 600 -> buff fails
      * 773 < 1000 -> displays MISS
* DEF down effect:
  * Example 1:
    * num3 = 1000
    * random roll = 928
    * num2 = 928 + 175 = 1103
    * 1103 > 1000 -> buff fails
      * 1103 > 1000 -> displays GUARD
  * Example 2:
    * num3 = 1000
    * random roll = 761
    * num2 = 761 + 175 = 936
    * 936 < 1000 -> buff procs

### How enemy's Critical Miss is determined

The critical miss sign appears if the enemy has a crit chance down debuff and would have crit without the debuff assuming the rng roll is the same.

### How the special summoning effects work

[Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/grandorder/comments/9pmta4/the_truth_in_code_summoning_gold_orbs_rainbow/) about gold orbs, rainbow orbs and silver to gold conversions.

### How hit damage is distributed

The following formula applies to all hits' damage except for the last one:

Hit damage = Card damage Ã— Hit Percentage / Sum of hits percentage (Note that `/` is [integer division](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/arithmetic-operators#integer-division))

The last hit's damage is calculated by subtracting the previous hits' damage from the card damage.

Therefore, the last hit's damage can be different from a prior hit's even with the same hit percentage. For example, Musashi's Buser card has `[33, 67]` damage distribution. With her first skill active, the damage distribution array becomes `[33, 33, 67, 67]`. With card damage of 15,228, the hits damage are `[2512, 2512, 5101, 5103]`:

```python
>>> 15228 * 33 // 200 # Hit 1; "//" is integer division
2512
>>> 15228 * 33 // 200 # Hit 2; 33+33+67+67=200
2512
>>> 15228 * 67 // 200 # Hit 3
5101
>>> 15228 - 2512 - 2512 - 5101 # Hit 4
5103
```

### How the Overkill bug happens

What is the Overkill bug?

> For cards (not NPs), if you hit an enemy below **half of the HP they had at the start of the current turn** you get 1.5x NP gain as if you were overkilling.

To determine which hit should have the overkill effect, the game keeps track of provisional damage between hits and compares it with the target's HP value. The target's HP is updated between cards while the provisional damage counter is not reset between cards. This leads to double counting of damage dealt and the effect of OK when the target's HP is less than half of its start value.

Here are some examples of how the game determines when the overkill effect applies and the overkill bug in action.

* Explanations of the tables' columns:
  * `reducedhp` is the provisional damage counter:
    * `reducedhp` is updated every hit
    * `reducedhp` starts at 0
    * `start reducedhp` + `damage` = `end reducedhp`
    * `start reducedhp` = usually previous hit's `end reducedhp` (see the Lancelot NP case for a different case)
  * `hp` is the target's HP value used for comparision with `reducedhp`:
    * `hp` is updated between cards
  * `OK` is whether the hit has overkill effect:
    * `end reducedhp` < `hp` -> Normal
    * `end reducedhp` > `hp` -> OK

* Scathach BQAE:

Scathach's quick card and first hit of the arts card experience overkill effect before she kills the target. Because the `hp` value is updated after the first card (14409 to 7300) while `reducedhp` is carried over from the first card, the overkill bug happens.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="./images/OK_Scathach.png" width="500"></div>

* Lancelot NP:

`reducedhp` is properly reset for Lancelot's NP card so the bug doesn't happen here. NP gain value is also shown in the table.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="./images/OK_Lancelot.png" width="500"></div>

* MHXA BAQE:

A video of the bug in action: https://www.bilibili.com/video/av34113229 @ 1:42. MHXA Arts card 2nd hit has the overkill bug.

### Enemy behavior after killing taunt servant

With the 2.0 update*, DW fixed this enemy behavior to be mostly consistent. Enemy will stop attacking after killing the taunt servant except for the following case:

> If an enemy kills the taunt servant in the **first** attack action and the taunt servant has guts, the **second** attack action will not happen but the **third** attack action  will.

You can see this scenario in this [gif](https://imgur.com/WSxjitJ). Lalter attacked and killed Spartacus with guts. Tesla didn't attack and Siegfried attacked instead.

**Note:** With the 2.0 update, I'm quite sure the behavior is the same even with enemy NP attack or attack with on-hit effects (e.g. Hokusai 3rd skill).

You can see in the following image the reasons for the enemy behavior.

* Table columns:
  * Scenario number: `1-6`
  * `tested`: whether all of the variables values are verified in the actual game
  * `1st attack`: outright kills the taunt servant, deals more than 50% hp or deals less than 50% hp of damage
  * `2nd attack`: kills the taunt servant or doesn't happen
  * `3rd attack`: happens or doesn't happen
  * Internal game variables and functions during the 3rd attack:
    * `hp`: the hp value
    * `isAlive`, `isGuts`, `checkDeadTurn`: 3 boolean flags of the **taunt servant**
    * `narrowDownHate`: returns the list of player servants with taunt. For example, the input of the function is `[1, 2, 3]` and the first servant has taunt, the output is `[1]`.
    * `getTargetBase`: returns the first "eligible" servant of the input list

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="./images/taunt_2.x.png" width="700"></div>

In all scenarios, even after the taunt servant is killed with or without guts, `narrowDownHate` returns the taunt servant, `[1]`. In scenarios 1, 2, 4-6, `getTargetBase` still considers `1` to be "dead" so it returns no eligible servant, `-1`, and there's no attack.

In scenario 3, the flag `isAlive` is switched to `True` in the 3rd attack as the guts servant `hp` value is updated. `getTargetBase` found an eligible servant and the 3rd attack happens (For the 2nd attack, `isAlive` is still `False`).

#### Pre 2.0 update behavior

The table below details the enemy behavior before the 2.0 update. The cells that changed with the 2.0 update are highlighted.

Generally, if the enemy deals more than 50% starting hp of damage and kills in the 2nd attack, there will be a 3rd attack.

**Note:** This doesn't apply to enemy NP attack or attack with on-hit effects (e.g. Hokusai 3rd skill).

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="./images/taunt_1.x.png" width="700"></div>

The above conditions sound familiar? Yes, the overkill bug rears its head again. Because of the overkill bug, `checkDeadTurn` is set to `False` and wreaks havoc on the downstream functions:
* Because the first attack deals more than 50% starting hp of damage, on the 2nd attack, `reducedhp` is greater than `hp`. Therefore, the game thinks the taunt servant is already dead and doesn't record `deadTurn` when the enemy kills the taunt servant.
* As the overkill bug prevents `deadTurn` from being recorded on the 2nd attack, `checkDeadTurn` returns `False` on the 3rd attack.
* `narrowDownHate` and `getTargetBase` behave differently with and without guts but essentially there will be a 3rd attack.

**Note:** I don't track the game code closely enough to know for sure that this behavior changes with the 2.0 update but the NA game code is definitely different between version 1.35.1 and 2.1.0. There's still this pre-2.0 [video](https://youtu.be/_5bFrrDGvro?t=140) that I haven't been able to explain.
